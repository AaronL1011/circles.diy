# circles.diy
### A community platform for creatives, makers, and builders.
circles.diy is born out of frustration with the current state of social networks. Mainstream platforms have twisted creativity and community into raw material for profit, attention, and control. They exploit your data, optimise for addiction and quietly erode communication with content-delivery algorithms. circles.diy rejects this model of operation with burning passion. We believe in building a space where creativity thrives on its own terms, where people gather in circles that they shape, sustain and own as a collective.

### How can circles.diy be different if its just another social platform? 
The million dollar question, a question we think about a lot. The critical flaws of conventional platforms are well known, but we have dared to propose an alternative approach.

### The Revenue Model
Conventional social platforms are "free" because of the ad-based revenue model behind the curtain. This model inherently creates a business incentive towards dark software patterns and engagement-hacking. To prevent it, the money has to come from somewhere else.

We've looked to the past for wisdom, searched for methods that successfully funded communities and promoted creativity and connection. In doing so, we landed on a unique combination of revenue streams for sustaining circles.diy
1. Decentralise the networks

Every circle is its own unit‚Äîsome self-hosted, some centrally hosted, some shared. Infrastructure costs scale with real community activity rather than a top-down push for growth. This makes hosting transparent, predictable, and collectively managed.

2. Circle Tithes (Community Stewardship)

Just as villages pooled resources through tithes and communal reserves, circles can choose to contribute predictable support‚Äîsmall dues, pooled funds, or even volunteered time. The platform never sells attention; it survives on shared stewardship that flows directly into hosting, moderation, and maintenance.

3. Skillshare as Currency

In villages, value didn‚Äôt just flow in goods or money, it flowed in skills. A carpenter mended a roof, a midwife ensured safe births, a blacksmith repaired tools. The exchange of knowledge kept communities resilient and bound people together.
circles.diy carries this principle into the digital age. Members can contribute not only money, but also skill. Sharing knowledge through workshops, tutorials, mentoring, or creative collaborations means that each circle becomes inherently rich with creative value and worth contributing to.

The common thread? Every revenue flow is anchored in real participation and creativity. Nothing comes from extracting attention. Everything comes from what members freely put back into the commons.

### Architecture of Belonging

A social network isn‚Äôt just code, it‚Äôs the shape of a community. We want circles.diy to embody the DIY ethos at its core: flexible enough that anyone can host their own space, yet accessible enough for those who simply want to join without software skills.

We envision three layers of participation:

- DIY Mode (Self-Hosted Nodes): For hackers and builders, a simple deployment with `docker compose up` gives full ownership of a circle. These nodes form the backbone of the network, embodying independence.
- Managed Hosting (Middle Ground): For communities who want their own circle but not the overhead, circles.diy offers hosted instances. Admins still govern, we simply provide the scaffolding.
- Commons Circles (Low Barrier): For those just arriving, shared public circles provide easy entry. Over time, thriving communities can fork into their own nodes without losing history or identity.

To make this work, circles.diy treats portability as sacred. A circle, its content, and its members can migrate between modes; self-hosted, managed, or commons; without loss. Protocol-level interoperability ensures circles aren‚Äôt silos, but threads in a larger woven fabric.

### Open Borders
Creativity has no bounds, we know this and our users know this, so creating yet another private "walled-garden" of a social network only adds to the problem. circles.diy firmly believes that the right to your content is yours, and where content lives should be up to the author.

This is why we are building a social platform with interoperability at its core, paying close attention to established and emerging social-networking protocols and ensuring users can not only distribute as much of their content as possible between compatible networks, but also have the ability to easily migrate their content to/from other platforms if they desire.

Why would we openly enable migration away from circles.diy? Because:
- We believe it solidifies our ethos against the destructive privitised patterns of conventional social networks.
- We believe if you build a good enough platform that provides **real** value to users, they won't want to leave ü§∑
- We believe in the power of high-quality communities to __attract__ fellow creatives, and want to make joining a circle as easy as possible üòá

## The circles.diy Manifesto

### 1. Community, not Capital

We will never treat people as commodities. Circles.diy will not sell data, profile behaviour, or manipulate attention for profit. Users are participants, not products. The platform exists to uplift creativity and community.

### 2. DIY Spirit

The platform reflects the culture it serves. Open, hackable, extensible. Built for the tinkerers, the creators, and the collaborators. You can fork it, self-host it, or build on it‚Äîbecause DIY means freedom.

### 3. Portability as a Right

Your content and connections are yours. Migration, federation, and interoperability are not features, they are guarantees. No circle, no platform, should ever hold your creativity hostage.

### 4. Participation over Extraction

Attention is not a resource to be strip-mined. Revenue flows only from what people willingly contribute‚Äîthrough stewardship, skills, or small pooled support. The commons is built by those who share, not those who exploit.

### 5. Knowledge as Wealth

In villages, survival depended on passing down knowledge‚Äîhow to plant, mend, build, or heal. Circles.diy embraces this truth for the digital age. Sharing skills and teaching others is not secondary; it is the heart of what makes a circle valuable.

### 6. Small, High-Quality Spaces

We do not chase ‚Äúscale.‚Äù We don‚Äôt want the biggest network, we want the most meaningful ones. Circles are built for intimacy, trust, and craft. A thousand strong communities matter more than a billion empty clicks.

### 7. Transparent Feeds, not Black Boxes

We reject algorithmic trickery designed to hijack attention. Content feeds in circles.diy are built on transparent, trusted methods: chronological order, explicit subscriptions, and community-driven curation. No hidden levers, no invisible shaping of what you see; only clear and understandable flows of content.

### 8. The Commons Comes First

Infrastructure is sustained like the old village granary: collectively, openly, and for the good of all. Transparency is mandatory, not optional. Everyone should know where resources come from and where they go.
