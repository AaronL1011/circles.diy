    <h3>A community platform for creatives, makers and builders.</h3>

    <p>circles.diy is born out of frustration with the current state of social networks. Mainstream platforms have
        twisted creativity and community into raw material for profit, attention and control. They exploit your data,
        optimise for addiction and quietly erode communication with content-delivery algorithms. We believe in building
        digital spaces where creativity thrives on its own
        terms, where people gather in circles that they shape, sustain and own as a collective.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>
            The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new.
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>How can circles.diy be different if it's just another social platform?</h3>
    <p>The million dollar question, one we think about a lot. The critical flaws of conventional platforms are
        well known and we have dared to propose an alternative approach:</p>

    <h3>The Revenue Model</h3>
    <p>Conventional social platforms are "free" because of the ad-based revenue model behind the curtain. This model
        inherently creates a business incentive towards dark software patterns and engagement-hacking. To prevent it,
        <i>the money has to come from somewhere else</i>.
    </p>

    <p>We've looked to the past for wisdom, searched for methods that successfully funded communities and promoted
        creativity and connection. In doing so, we landed on a unique combination of revenue streams for sustaining
        circles.diy</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Decentralise the networks</strong><br>
            Every circle is its own unit; some self-hosted, some centrally hosted, some shared. Infrastructure costs
            scale with real community activity rather than a top-down push for growth. This makes hosting transparent,
            predictable and collectively managed.<br><br>
            A circle can be whatever people need it to be: a gathering place for a craft or hobby, a hub for a local
            community, or a digital home for friends and family. Some circles may thrive around passions like
            woodworking, tattooing, or music; others may form around specific places, like a local
            neighbourhood. Each circle carries its own identity, culture and governance, but together they weave into a
            larger social fabric.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Circle Tithes (Community Stewardship)</strong><br>
            Just as villages pooled resources through tithes and communal reserves, participants of a circle can choose
            to contribute
            predictable support; small dues, pooled funds, or even volunteered time. The platform never sells attention;
            it survives on shared stewardship that flows directly into hosting, moderation, and maintenance.</li>

        <li><strong>Skillshare as Currency</strong><br>
            In a village, value doesn't just flow in goods or money, it flows in skills. A carpenter mends a roof, a
            midwife ensures safe births, a blacksmith repairs tools. The exchange of knowledge keeps communities
            resilient and binds people together.<br>
            circles.diy carries this principle into the digital age. Members can contribute not only money, but also
            skill. Sharing knowledge through workshops, tutorials, mentoring, or creative collaborations means that each
            circle becomes inherently rich with creative value and worth being a part of.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The common thread? Every revenue flow is anchored in real participation and creativity. Nothing comes from
        extracting attention. Everything comes from what members freely put back into the commons.</p>

    <h3>Architecture of Belonging</h3>
    <p>A social network isn't just code, it's the shape of a community. We want circles.diy to embody the DIY ethos at
        its core: flexible enough that anyone can host their own space, yet accessible enough for those who simply want
        to join without software skills.</p>

    <p>We envision three layers of participation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Commons Circles (Low Barrier):</strong> For those just arriving, shared public circles provide easy
            entry. Over time, thriving communities can fork into their own nodes without losing history or identity.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Managed Hosting (Middle Ground):</strong> For communities who want their own circle but not the
            overhead, circles.diy offers hosted instances. Admins still govern, we simply provide the scaffolding.</li>
        <li><strong>DIY Mode (Self-Hosted Nodes):</strong> For hackers and builders, a simple deployment with
            <code>docker compose up</code> gives full ownership of a circle. These nodes form the backbone of the
            network, embodying independence.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>To make this work, circles.diy treats portability as sacred. A circle, its content, and its members can migrate
        between modes; self-hosted, managed, or commons; without loss. Protocol-level interoperability ensures circles
        aren't silos, but threads in a larger social fabric.</p>

    <h3>Open Borders</h3>
    <p>Creativity has no bounds, we know this and our users know this, so creating yet another private "walled-garden"
        social network only adds to the problem. circles.diy firmly believes that the right to your content is yours,
        where content lives should be up to the author.</p>

    <p>This is why we are building a social platform with interoperability at its core, paying close attention to
        established and emerging social-networking protocols and ensuring users can not only distribute as much of their
        content as possible between compatible networks, but also have the ability to easily migrate their content
        to/from other platforms if they desire.</p>

    <p>Why would we openly enable migration away from circles.diy? Because:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We believe it solidifies our ethos against the destructive patterns of privitised social networks.</li>
        <li>We believe if you build a good enough platform that provides <strong>real</strong> value to users, they
            won't want to leave ðŸ¤·</li>
        <li>We believe in the power of high-quality communities to <strong>attract</strong> fellow creatives and we want to
            make joining a circle as easy as possible ðŸ˜‡</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="manifesto">
        <h2>The circles.diy Manifesto</h2>

        <h3>1. Community, not Capital</h3>
        <p>We will never treat people as commodities. circles.diy will not sell data, profile behaviour, or manipulate
            attention for profit. Users are participants, not products. The platform exists to uplift creativity and
            community.</p>

        <h3>2. DIY Spirit</h3>
        <p>The platform reflects the culture it serves. Open, hackable, extensible. Built for the tinkerers, the
            creators and the collaborators. You can fork it, self-host it, or build on it; because DIY means freedom.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Portability as a Right</h3>
        <p>Your content and connections are yours. Migration, federation, and interoperability are not features, they
            are guarantees. No circle, no platform, should ever hold your creativity hostage.</p>

        <h3>4. Participation over Extraction</h3>
        <p>Attention is not a resource to be strip-mined. Revenue flows only from what people willingly contribute;
            through stewardship, skills, or small pooled support. The commons is built by those who share, not those who
            exploit.</p>

        <h3>5. Knowledge as Wealth</h3>
        <p>In villages, survival depended on passing down knowledge; how to plant, mend, build or heal. circles.diy
            embraces this truth for the digital age. Sharing skills and teaching others is not secondary; it is the
            heart of what makes a circle valuable.</p>

        <h3>6. Small, High-Quality Spaces</h3>
        <p>We do not chase "scale." We don't want the biggest network, we want the most meaningful ones. Circles are
            built for intimacy, trust and craft. A thousand strong communities matter more than a billion empty clicks.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Transparent Feeds, not Black Boxes</h3>
        <p>We reject algorithmic trickery designed to hijack attention. Content feeds in circles.diy are built on
            transparent, trusted methods: chronological order, explicit subscriptions and community-driven curation. No
            hidden levers, no invisible shaping of what you see; only clear and understandable flows of content.</p>

        <h3>8. The Commons Comes First</h3>
        <p>Infrastructure is sustained like the old village granary: collectively, openly and for the good of all.
            Transparency is mandatory, not optional. Everyone should know where resources come from and where they go.
        </p>

        <h3>9. Keep the Good, Leave the Rot</h3>
        <p>Not everything in todayâ€™s social platforms is broken. circles.diy commits to carrying forward what works;
            fast access across devices, secure communication where it matters, multimedia support and interfaces that
            feel intuitive and beautiful. What we leave behind are the manipulative patterns, the noise and the
            extractive incentives. We keep the tools that empower creativity and discard the rot that erodes community.
        </p>

        <h3>10. Uplift the Creatives</h3>
        <p>
            circles.diy is built by and for creatives. We believe every individual should be free to represent their
            work and identity without compromise. Profiles can be living portfolios; spaces to showcase craft, connect
            with collaborators, and grow sustainable practices. Tools for creative business, presentation, and exchange
            are woven in by design, giving individuals the means to thrive without bending to the extractive models of
            mainstream platforms.
